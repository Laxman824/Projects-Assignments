Subtask2- Task 1
Using Background Subtractor and Optical Flow to calculate Queue and Dynamic density of vehicles using traffic camera's video as input

- Cross check if you have task2.cpp and Makefile in the same folder
- Open the terminal and type 'make' and enter
- After the compilation completes, type in ./task2 video_name.mp4 (if your image is video.mp4, type ./task1 video.mp4)
- The processing should start now. It takes roughly 7~8 minutes to process a 6 min video, during which the time(in sec), queue density and dynamic density
    is printed on the console as well as in a text file 'out.txt' 
    (The program processes all 15 frames per second, and outputs the averaged densities of 15 frames)

- The graph present in the folder was made using LibreOffice
